WheatherApp

It is a simple application made with vanilla JS (using the Fetch API and some functionality), CSS, and Bootstrap.
Using a weather API, we can retrieve the weather forecast for the next 24 hours for the searched location.
This was one of the first web pages that I created at the beginning of my web development journey.

API used: https://openweathermap.org/api

Search a location and get weather details for the next 24h.

HTML/CSS/JS and Bootstrap
